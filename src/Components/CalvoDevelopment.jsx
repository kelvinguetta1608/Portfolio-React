                        As a Game Developer within a team of 10 members from Universidad Aut√≥noma de Occidente, I am contributing to the development of an exciting Third-Person Shooter (TPS) game, which is currently under construction. My primary responsibilities include the design and development of the Heads-Up Display (HUD). For the HUD, I designed buttons, banners, and visual elements using Illustrator, implementing them into an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

                    <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                        Regarding the customization functionality, I developed a dynamic system using ScriptableObjects that allows for the selection and customization of a single character with various outfits. This system is designed to be scalable and adaptable, making it easier to incorporate new customization options in the future.

                    <p className="text-lg">
                        Another significant contribution was the design and integration of a special shader that functions as a "wallhack," a strategic feature activated as an "ultimate ability" when a player achieves five eliminations. This project combines design, programming, and creativity, and my contribution focuses on creating an immersive and user-centered experience that balances functionality and style as we work toward completing the game.
