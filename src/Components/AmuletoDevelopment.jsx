                        Amuleto de Jade is a dark, desolate mystery game set in 1920s London, inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Players take on the role of an investigator following a cryptic letter from their friend Carter, who details his death after the theft of a jade amulet. This theft unleashes the Winged Hound, a malevolent entity that hunts the player, accompanied by minions like zombies and screamers. The story challenges players to unravel the mystery behind Carter's demise.

                        To progress, players must solve puzzles, interact with NPCs for crucial information, and recover the stolen amulet. The gameplay is designed to immerse players in a haunting atmosphere, combining investigation and survival elements. The final confrontation with the Winged Hound occurs in a cemetery, where the player must use their skills and resources to restore order and defeat the entity.

                        My role in the project was focused on programming the enemy logic, including zombies, screamers, and the Winged Houndâ€”a fire-breathing flying entity. I also worked on their animations, ensuring they contributed to the eerie tone of the game. Additionally, I implemented NPC dialogues and developed some of the puzzles, enhancing the interactive storytelling experience.
